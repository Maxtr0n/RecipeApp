# RecipeApp

ASP.net Core WebAPI + Angular frontend for my Recipe Application hobby project. Mainly intended to practice and improve my ASP.NET Core skills 
and learn concepts and best-practices like Clean Architecture, DDD, CQRS and other stuff.

The app will allow users to upload and share recipes between each other.
